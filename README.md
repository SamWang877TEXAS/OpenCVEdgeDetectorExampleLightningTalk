# OpenCV Canny and Edge Detection
Welcome to the code example! Feel free to download the example and change the parameters around.
You can even upload your own image, though you may have to mess with the cv.imshow() or matplotlib display commands to ensure the image fits on your screen!

Make sure to install any packages if you don't have them already.

NOTE: opencv is actually "pip install opencv-python"
